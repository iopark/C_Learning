# C_Learning
----
<br>Part of the reverse learning from C#
Where the main task of the learning has been understanding fundamentals behind C#
----
various topics are subjects to update in due time.
One of the core benefits of learning programming through C is in perceiving programming without the concept of a 'class'. 
Where program through library or local codes are compiled into object codes, learning C have allowed myself to visualize code in a much simpler form. Ways in which stacks are formed on top of another functions, ways in which other scripts subdivided by programmer interacts and 'combines' together through build process, have allowed me to understand background in which DLL or external libraries can interact with programs compiled using different languages. Lastly, subject surrounding C encourages me to dig deeper in two vastly different yet connected subjects. 

1. Ways in which CPU comprehends assembly or object code. 
2. Ways in which Operating System manages built programs and or services. 


C# 을 배우면서 사실 스택영역, 코드영역, 데이터 영역, 마지막으로 힙영역을 다룬다고는 하지만, 
막상 머리속에 그려지지 않아 기본기를 쌓고자 C 를 학습하기 시작했다. 
우선적으로 목표하는바는 아래와 같으며 이것은 학습을 통해 달라질것을 목표로 한다. 

1. 포인터의 개념 적립. 
2. 빌드과정 이해 하기 
3. Library, 그리고 DLL 이해하기 

<ul> 
  <li>pointers</li>
  <li>build process</li>
  <li>memory address</li>
  <li>binaries, bit operation</li>
  <li>ways in which computer reads codes seperated by sequence points.</li>
</ul>
